# GitHub access levels

Choose the least access the Agent needs. Each binding selects one level for one
repository; Namespace policy determines which levels are available.

| Console choice          | Configuration value | Meaning                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read-only               | `git-read`          | Requests read access where the selected delivery supports it.                 |
| Contributor, issues off | `git-write`         | Requests write access subject to the selected repository policy and delivery. |
| Contributor             | `git-full`          | Requests broader access where the selected delivery supports it.              |

These labels express requested access, not a token permission map or a guarantee that any
particular command is available. The [prepared native profile](prepared-native-git.md) accepts
`git-write` for one repository and one exact writable ref. Its Git-only transport permits Git
operations; `git-and-draft-pr` also permits one draft PR for the approved head and base. The
worker requests only the provider permissions needed for that selected transport.

The separately selected [development token authority](development-token.md) retains the token's
own GitHub permissions. Its profile controls forwarded REST write routes, and its configured
allowlist bounds Git pushes. GraphQL is denied unless explicitly enabled for an eligible token;
when enabled it remains read-only and is unavailable to `git-read`.

The Console starts with Contributor as the Agent default. Added repositories
inherit it until customized by expanding their card. Turning off issue management
selects `git-write`; each repository must permit its resulting profile.

Agent create, provision, and update requests can use `repositoryAccess`:

```json
{
  "defaultProfile": "git-write",
  "repositories": [{ "repositoryRef": "application" }]
}
```

An omitted entry profile inherits `defaultProfile`. An explicit profile remains
custom even when equal to the default. Responses retain this intent alongside
resolved `repositoryBindings`; saved versions contain concrete profiles.
Changing desired access affects future deployments only. An empty repositories
array removes attachments while retaining the default.

`repositoryAccess` and `repositoryBindings` are mutually exclusive request fields.
For direct `repositoryBindings`, omitting `profile` still selects **`git-write`**.
Agents without saved intent open with their existing profiles marked custom.
Omitting both fields during update preserves existing settings; updating direct
bindings clears inheritance intent. Profiles remain subject to Namespace policy.

## API and branch boundaries

GitHub App `contents: write` permission is repository-wide. The prepared native sender enforces
the exact approved ref before sending the push; GitHub repository rules still apply. The
[push-ref guardrail](push-ref-guardrail.md) explains what the client hook and sender each enforce.
A push can trigger repository CI, so review that CI's own secret and execution policy.

A Git-only session does not admit REST or GraphQL. Draft transport admits only its bounded draft
operation. Neither profile supports arbitrary GitHub CLI commands, merges, forks, SSH or LFS.
A lost response does not authorize repeating a push or draft creation.

## Supported commands

Use ordinary `git clone`, `git fetch` and `git push` to the approved ref. With a draft grant, use
`oce-github pr-create --draft` with the approved head and base. The explicit development-token
profile can also use `gh api` for permitted REST routes; it does not establish production GitHub
App behavior.

For Agent setup, use the [team runbook](../../guides/repository-credentials/team-runbook.md).
